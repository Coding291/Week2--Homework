                    My name is Muhammad Humayun Azam and I am a Junior at Rutgers University- New Brunswick, a computer science major who is compassionate about java programming and databases. Moreover, eager to explore new programming languages such as “C++” which is used in Unix/Linux leads to a similar foundation as software developer: Cybersecurity. As a Junior, I have a decent knowledge from basic Algorithm development and basic procedural and object- oriented problem-solving techniques to the software engineering principles of encapsulation, information hiding and code reuse, and discusses how these concepts are used to build abstract data types.

                   I completed my A.S in computer science in May 2022. After the completion of my Freshmen year, i got an internship in a company named Spencers and Spirit where i was assigned my role as junior Cyber Security Analyst. I worked with some increible people from Cyber Security and Networking department. Now i am junior in Rutgers hoping to pursue to B.S in computer science and also further my career with the help of this bootcamp that i am currently enrolled in and graduate as a Full Stack Web Developer.

                   My recent future goal is to successfully graduate from the bootcamp and get a job as a software developer while nearing the end of bootcamp or soon enough after i graduate. I have this mindset that having A.S in computer science where i was taught to master Java and considering my enrollment in Rutgers to pursue Bachelors. I belive this bootcamp will be a huge boost for me to get where i want to be before time.
